## Tereza Petrovicova

Hello! I am Tereza, a third-year Ph.D. student in Political Science at UC San Diego. 
My research centers on the political economy of the energy transition, particularly on the intersection of business and politics. 
In particular, I am interested in how lobbying and related factors influence the location of renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind, and the broader implications for communities.
In my work, I employ computational social science methods, utilizing tools such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and text analysis.
